This number has been steadily increasing with time as more people are forced to flee their homes. Even though the number of forcibly displaced people is increasing year by year, many countries have closed their borders for families seeking protection and slashed their refugee quotas. In July 2019, the U.S. proposed a refugee resettlement ceiling of 18,000 for fiscal year 2020, a record low and a significant drop from the 97,000 ceiling in 2016. Austria and other countries in the EU led by populist/nativist politicians have closed all doors to asylum-seekers. The following link provides an interactive insider view into the life of a refugee - https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-32057601 This topic was chosen because of the team’s interest in working towards social issues &amp; because of the severity of the problem. This analysis aims to answer the following questions - How have the Global Refugee Trends changed with time? What are the key factors influencing these trends? Are News Articles also indicative of these identified trends? "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 What is the Problem? 2.2 What are the Reasons? 2.3 Can this be Validated?", " Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 What is the Problem? The first Dataset that this analysis needed was about the Population of Refugees. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is a UN agency mandated to aid and protect refugees. It also maintains a Refugee Population Statistics Database which is collected from the following 3 sources - UNHCR Statistical Data Collection, United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East Data &amp; Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre Data. This Dataset is available at - https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/download/?url=E1ZxP4 and was used for this analysis. The Dataset contains variables like Year, Country of Origin, Country of Asylum, Number of Refugees and Asylum Applications and is available in the form of an interactive dashboard. This Dataset was chosen since UNHCR is the World’s Prime Agency for Refugee Repatriation Work and because of the credibility of The UN. Some limitations with this Dataset are that it is available only at the yearly level and not at the monthly level &amp; it has slow refresh cycles. 2.2 What are the Reasons? The next Dataset that this analysis needed was about the Reasons behind Refugee Crises. The World Bank publishes a Dataset on World Development Indicators (WDI) under the World Bank Open Data Databank. It is the primary World Bank collection of development indicators, compiled from officially recognized international sources. It presents the most current and accurate global development data available, and includes national, regional and global estimates. This Dataset is available at - https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators and was used for this analysis. The Dataset contains 1465 variables like Population, Literacy Rate, Death Rate, Birth Rate etc. by Year and Country &amp; is available in the form of an interactive dashboard. This Dataset was chosen since The World Bank Open Data Initiative consolidates a lot of different sources and because of it’s synergy with the previous UNHCR Dataset. One limitation with this Dataset is that the number of missing values varies a lot by country and can only be figured out after downloading the data. 2.3 Can this be Validated? The next Dataset that this analysis needed was about the Validation of our Analysis. The New York Times published close to 84,000 articles in 2016. (Source - https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/05/how-many-stories-do-newspapers-publish-per-day/483845/) These Articles can be scraped using The New York Times Article Search API - https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/articlesearch-product/1/overview and can then be analyzed to gain an insight into the reasons behind the Refugee Crises. The Dataset contains variables like Article ID, Date of Publishing, Article URL, Article Title &amp; Article Abstract and can be downloaded as a CSV. This Dataset was chosen since Archit Matta from the team was involved in developing and using the New York Times Scraper as part of another engagement. One limitation with this Dataset is that the final results can be biased because of the choice of the News Source.

This Data came with descriptive headers which were excluded during ingestion. Data with Country Name - ‘Unknown’ was then removed. Since the average refugee crisis length is 17 years, this analysis only looked at the years 2000 - 2020 to exclude old crises. (Source - https://blogs.worldbank.org/dev4peace/2019-update-how-long-do-refugees-stay-exile-find-out-beware-averages) A cross analysis between Country of Origin and Country of Asylum was done only for the Top 5 countries by Refugee Population due to size constraints. The Top 5 Countries were observed to be - Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan Global Refugee Population Data by Country of Asylum vs Country of Origin for just these 5 countries from UNHCR - https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/data.html was extracted. 3.2 World Bank Databank World Bank Global Development Databank - https://data.worldbank.org/ was used to extract data about Adult Literacy Rate, Youth Literacy Rate, Mortality Rate, Total Deaths by Injuries, Total Deaths, Hospital Beds per Capita &amp; GDP per Capita by Country and Year for the period 2000 - 2020. This Data came with descriptive headers which were excluded during ingestion. Blank values were represented by ‘..’ and were converted to NULL to ensure consistency. Average values by Country and Field were calculated over the entire time period. This Dataset was then joined with the Refugee Population Database using Country ISO Codes. The transformation for this Dataset was conducted in Excel. 3.3 New York Times Article Data News Articles from The New York Times containing any of the following terms - Afghanistan Refugees, Syria Refugees, Iraq Refugees, Somalia Refugees and Sudan Refugees were scraped. (Source - https://github.com/jsonkao/nyt-articles) The Article ‘Abstract’ was picked as the Text Corporus for this analysis. The Text Data was processed to remove Numbers, Punctuation, Whitespace and Stopwords. All words were then converted to Lower Case to ensure consistency. Some specific phrases like ‘000’ and ‘mr.’ which came up in the most frequent words were also removed. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values UNHCR Refugee Data The Refugee Data had a lot of missing values. However since this was time series data, not all missing values were significant. For example - Angola had Refugee Numbers starting from 1960 while Colombia had Refugee Numbers starting from 1981. So even though Colombia would have missing values from 1960 to 1980, these would not be significant as it did not have a Refugee Crisis at that time. Thus the missing values were split into 2 categories - Significant - Missing Values after the First Non-NULL Year Insignificant - Missing Values before the First Non-NULL Year This distinction was arrived based on the above example as the first Non-NULL year by country would indicate the start of a Refugee Crisis and the missing values after this year would be ‘missing’ while the missing values before this year would be ‘absent’. It can be observed that the proportion of Significant Missing Values out of the Total Missing values is more in the time period 2000 - 2020 in comparison to 1960 - 2020. The absolute percentage of Significant Missing Values out of the Total Values for the time period 1960 - 2020 is 0.82% and for the time period 2000 - 2020 is 0.39%. It can be observed that the number of Missing Values seems to have a decresing trend with Year. World Bank Databank The World Bank Databank had all values missing for 2020. This could be because of a Data Refresh Delay. The other missing values did not have a direct impact as the average over the entire time period was calculated. New York Times Article Data The New York Times Dataset did not have any missing values in the Abstract field. This could be because of some sanity checks by the New York Times Article Search API.

It can be seen that a significant number of refugees come from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Region. Taking a closer look at the MENA Region, we observe Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan to be the Top 5 Countries of Origin for Refugees Globally. 5.2 Which countries do most Refugees go to? It can be seen that a significant number of refugees go to the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Region. There is also some number of Refugees that go to the North America and Asia Regions. Taking a closer look at the MENA Region, we observe that the Top Countries by Asylum are neighboring to the Top Countries by Origin. This falls in line with expectations as Most Refugees travel by Road and thus can’t travel to farther regions. (Source - https://www.roads-to-refuge.com.au/journeys/journeys-crossing.html) One interesting takeaway from the Origin and Asylum Maps is that Syria and Ethiopia show up in both Top Countries by Origin and Top Countries by Asylum. This indicates that there is a significant number of Internally Displaced People in these 2 countries. (Refugees within their own Country) 5.3 What are some indicators of Refugee Migration? 5.3.1 Infant Mortality Rate The above Map shows Refugee Population by Origin for 2000 - 2020 in Millions overlayed with Bubbles whose size correspond to Average Infant Mortality Rate by Country. Thus, a large bubble indicates a high mortality rate while a small bubble indicates a low mortality rate. Absolute values for Infant Mortality Rate have been omitted since this visualization is only trying to observe correlations. It can be observed that the countries having High Number of Refugees also tend to have Higher Infant Mortality Rates as the Darker Regions on the Map have Bigger Circles in them. This can be expected because Infants are the most affected by the Refugee Lifestyle. 5.3.2 Injury Related Deaths It can be observed from the above 2 Maps that the countries having High Number of Refugees also tend to have Higher Percentage of Injury Related Deaths. This can be expected because many Refugee Crises happen in War-Struck Countries. 5.3.3 Hospital Beds Looking at the above 3 Maps, no obvious relation can be observed between either Country of Origin &amp; Hospital Beds or Country of Asylum &amp; Hospital Beds as the High and Low values for Each Map are observed at different places. 5.3.4 Literacy Rate This plot shows the countries on y-axis in decreasing order of Number of Refugees. It can be said that Countries with Literacy Rates greater than 90% generally have Low Number of Refugees. 5.3.5 Gross Domestic Product This plot shows the countries on y-axis in decreasing order of Number of Refugees. It can be said that Countries with very high GDP per Capita generally have Low Number of Refugees. 5.4 Do the Countries with Most Refugees show some Common Trend? Refugees - Number of Refugees ALR - Average Adult Literacy Rate YLR - Average Youth Literacy Rate IMR - Average Infant Mortality Rate PID - Average Percentage of Injury Deaths DR - Average Death Rate per 1000 HB - Average Hospital Beds per 1000 GDP - Average Gross Domestic Prouct per Capita (USD) After filtering the Top 5 Countries by the Number of Refugees on the Interactive Plot, it can be seen that they show a similar trend in some variables. The usually have Medium Literacy Rates, High Injury-Related and Overall Death Rates, Low Hospital Beds &amp; Low GDP per Capita. 5.5 Can the Findings of the Analysis be validated? The Wordcloud created from scraping relevant New York Times articles since 2000 provides some very interesting insights into the Refugee Crises around the World. Words like Millions, Killed, Lives and Home shed some light on the seriousness of the problem. Violence, Terrorism, Students and Children are some of the Top Words and the presence of these words validate the previous graphical analysis. In addition, there are some words like America, Donald, Trump and Bush which require a Deeper Contextual Analysis.

In the Origin Countries Chart, we can see the trends of changing refugee population by year for the top 5 countries of origin by refugee population, namely: Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan. As we click on the button for each of the 5 countries, we can see the refugee population trends from the country of origin to the top 5 countries of asylum. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion Learnings Looking at a subset of the Data having similar scale of values can provide New Insights. This is seen in the MENA focused Maps drawn after the World Map. Looking at Multiple Graphs in conjunction can help understand correlations. This is seen in the Injury Related Deaths Maps. Plotting the Same Data on Multiple Graphs can yield Different Insights. This is seen in the Feature Parallel Coordinate Plot. Limitations The impact of each variable like Mortality Rate, Death Rate etc. on Refugee Population has been analyzed individually. The Interactive D3 Graph is created only for a subset of countries. Important Milestones like Start of the Syrian War are mentioned as text below the graph. The News Article Data used for this project is biased as it has been taken from just one source - The New York Times and can be observed in the results as a lot of American Terms show up in articles. Future Directions Doing an analysis to observe the combined impact of variables in a Multivariate Format. Creating the D3 Graph for the entire dataset with Country of Origin acting as a Filter. Marking Important Milestones on the graph timeline as straight line placeholders. Removing the News Article Bias by Scraping Data from Multiple Sources Across the Globe. "]]
