This Data came with descriptive headers which were excluded during ingestion. Data with Country Name - ‘Unknown’ was then removed. Since the average refugee crisis length is 17 years, this analysis only looked at the years 2000 - 2020 to exclude old crises. (Source - https://blogs.worldbank.org/dev4peace/2019-update-how-long-do-refugees-stay-exile-find-out-beware-averages) A cross analysis between Country of Origin and Country of Asylum was done only for the Top 5 countries by Refugee Population due to size constraints. The Top 5 Countries were observed to be - Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan Global Refugee Population Data by Country of Asylum vs Country of Origin for just these 5 countries from UNHCR - https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/data.html was extracted. 3.2 World Bank Databank World Bank Global Development Databank - https://data.worldbank.org/ was used to extract data about Adult Literacy Rate, Youth Literacy Rate, Mortality Rate, Total Deaths by Injuries, Total Deaths, Hospital Beds per Capita &amp; GDP per Capita by Country and Year for the period 2000 - 2020. This Data came with descriptive headers which were excluded during ingestion. Blank values were represented by ‘..’ and were converted to NULL to ensure consistency. Average values by Country and Field were calculated over the entire time period. This Dataset was then joined with the Refugee Population Database using Country ISO Codes. The transformation for this Dataset was conducted in Excel. 3.3 New York Times Article Data News Articles from The New York Times containing any of the following terms - Afghanistan Refugees, Syria Refugees, Iraq Refugees, Somalia Refugees and Sudan Refugees were scraped. (Source - https://github.com/jsonkao/nyt-articles) The Article ‘Abstract’ was picked as the Text Corporus for this analysis. The Text Data was processed to remove Numbers, Punctuation, Whitespace and Stopwords. All words were then converted to Lower Case to ensure consistency. Some specific phrases like ‘000’ and ‘mr.’ which came up in the most frequent words were also removed. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values UNHCR Refugee Data The Refugee Data had a lot of missing values. However since this was time series data, not all missing values were significant. For example - Angola had Refugee Numbers starting from 1960 while Colombia had Refugee Numbers starting from 1981. So even though Colombia would have missing values from 1960 to 1980, these would not be significant as it did not have a Refugee Crisis at that time. Thus the missing values were split into 2 categories - Significant - Missing Values after the First Non-NULL Year Insignificant - Missing Values before the First Non-NULL Year This distinction was arrived based on the above example as the first Non-NULL year by country would indicate the start of a Refugee Crisis and the missing values after this year would be ‘missing’ while the missing values before this year would be ‘absent’. It can be observed that the proportion of Significant Missing Values out of the Total Missing values is more in the time period 2000 - 2020 in comparison to 1960 - 2020. The absolute percentage of Significant Missing Values out of the Total Values for the time period 1960 - 2020 is 0.82% and for the time period 2000 - 2020 is 0.39%. It can be observed that the number of Missing Values seems to have a decresing trend with Year. World Bank Databank The World Bank Databank had all values missing for 2020. This could be because of a Data Refresh Delay. The other missing values did not have a direct impact as the average over the entire time period was calculated. New York Times Article Data The New York Times Dataset did not have any missing values in the Abstract field. This could be because of some sanity checks by the New York Times Article Search API.
